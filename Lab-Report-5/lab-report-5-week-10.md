# Lab Report 5

### How did I found the tests with different results?
I ran ```script.sh``` to see the different outputs that were generated by ```MarkdownParse```. Then I manually went and took a look at those that seemed interseting.

<br/>


## Test 14:
For this test the class implementation of ```MarkdownParse.java``` and our own version gave an incorrect output.

_Test:_

```
\*not emphasized*
\<br/> not a tag
\[not a link](/foo)
\`not code`
1\. not a list
\* not a list
\# not a heading
\[foo]: /url "not a reference"
\&ouml; not a character entity
```

_Expected:_

__Fix:__

Both of the codes do not show the expected output because the tests has all the characteristics of a link. However, at the beginning it has a backslash which does not make it a link. Thanks to this character the expected output is different from out outputs. One possible fix for this test is to check for any backslash before the first bracket. By doing this, you can get the expected output because the code will ignore any link that has a backslash right before the first bracket.

## Test 577:
For this test the class implementation of ```MarkdownParse.java``` was not able to get the expected output. However, our own implementation of ```MarkdownParse.java``` was able to get the expected output.

_Test:_

```
![foo](<url>)
```

_Expected:_

> Since the test only includes the link for an image, it should not be included in the output.

__Why does my code work?__

The problem that this test is causing on the class version of ```MarkdownParse.java``` is that there is no way of differentiating between links and images. This is why it thinks that there is a link in the test when in reality it is an image. In my version of ```MarkdownParse.java``` there is a way to distinguish between images and links. This is accomplished by checking if the character before the first bracket is a ```!```.
