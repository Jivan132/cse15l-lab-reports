### In this tutorial, you will learn how to log in into a course-specific account on “ieng6”.
1. The first step will be to install VScode. You can do this by going to “https://code.visualstudio.com/” and there you can download the latest version. Once it is installed, you will see something similar to this when you open it.

Then, click on new terminal and it will pop-up at the bottom. In there you will type “ssh [course specific account]” (you can find your account name and reset your password [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)). After this, you will be prompted to type your password, be careful typing it because you will not be able to see what you are typing or how many characters you are typing.

RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
